-   npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simpleswap.git
cd simpleswap

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è API Notes

-   **Development**: The app uses mock data to avoid CORS issues during local development
-   **Production**: In production, the app will attempt to fetch real-time data from CoinGecko API
-   **API Limits**: CoinGecko has rate limits, so the app gracefully falls back to mock data if needed

## üîß Customization

### Theme Configuration

The app uses a comprehensive theme system located in `src/theme.js`:

```javascript
// Custom color palette
const colors = {
  primary: { main: '#1976d2', light: '#42a5f5', dark: '#1565c0' },
  // ... more colors
};

// Component overrides
components: {
  MuiButton: {
    styleOverrides: {
      root: {
        borderRadius: 8,
        // ... custom styles
      }
    }
  }
}
```
